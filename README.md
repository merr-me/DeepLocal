# DeepLocal, Offline Translator (WPF + Ollama)

### DeepLocal is a clean WPF desktop app that brings DeepL-style translation fully offline via Ollama. Two-pane UI, auto-detect, swap, and model picker (default: gemma3:12b). Built with .NET 8.

# ‚ú® Features

Interface inspired by DeepL: two panels (source ‚Üí translation)

Auto-detect of the source language (the selector automatically switches to the recognized language)

Coherent swap (swaps texts and languages without forcing English)

Ollama model selector (default gemma3:12b; mistral:latest, aya-expanse:8b, gpt-oss:20b, gpt-oss:120b-cloud)

Quick actions: Paste, Copy, Translate ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Tray app: starts minimized, double-click to show/hide, right-click menu

Window position anchored to the bottom-right when it reappears from the tray

Main supported languages (IT, EN, ES, FR, DE, PT, RU, HE, JA, ZH). For unsupported languages: ‚Äúlanguage not supported‚Äù

# üì¶ Requirements

Windows 10/11

Ollama running at http://127.0.0.1:11434

.NET 8 SDK (only if you want to build from source)

# ‚úÖ Compatible models (tested)

- gemma3:12b (Default)

- mistral:latest

- aya-expanse:8b

- gpt-oss:20b

- gpt-oss:120b-cloud

Quick model installation (Ollama):
```bash
ollama pull gemma3:12b
ollama pull mistral:latest
ollama pull aya-expanse:8b
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
# If available in your instance:
ollama pull gpt-oss:120b-cloud
```

DeepLocal selects gemma3:12b by default. You can change the model from the menu at the top right.
Note: gpt-oss:120b-cloud may not be available on all local installations; in that case use gemma3:12b or one of the other listed models.
